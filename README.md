## Tranings
At this point I've started two important training courses:
- Google's Android Basics with JetPack Compose
- freeCodeCamp's Python Certification Training

### A. Android Basics with JetPack Compose
Google's beginners course for Android native development with Kotlin and JetPack Compose, this is phase 1 of the skill up program I designed with Google's Gemini to become a Kotlin fullstack (mobile) developer by May 31, 2026.
This constitutes the frontend (mobile) part of the training. It's supposed to end this January 6, 2026. Phase 2 is the backend development with Spring Boot in Kotlin.

Being stuck in Unit 4, pathway 2, I'm now trying to push forward. I'm actually practicing the "Navigate between screens with Compose" codelab. It's not a piece of cake to order some cupcakes when navigating multiple screen while managing the state of the app.
